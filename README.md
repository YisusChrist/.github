This is my `.github` repository, it houses all the [community health files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file) and the [issue templates](https://github.com/Emilia-Capital/.github/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) that can be shared across all my different repositories.
